It runs as a separate background process and continuously copies write-ahead log pages from disk to one or more replicas. This asynchronous replication provides disaster recovery similar to what is available with database servers like Postgres or MySQL.
Understanding the WAL SQLite has a journaling mode called &amp;ldquo;WAL&amp;rdquo; (write-ahead log) which writes database page changes to a separate -wal file first before later copying those pages back into the main database file.</description></item><item><title>How-To Guides</title><link>https://litestream.io/guides/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://litestream.io/guides/</guid><description>Overview These guides provides instructions for running Litesteam in production on different platforms.
